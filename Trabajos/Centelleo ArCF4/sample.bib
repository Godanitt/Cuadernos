journal = {Journal of Instrumentation},
abstract = {We describe a novel fast optical imager, TimepixCam, based on an optimized silicon pixel sensor with a thin entrance window, read out by a Timepix ASIC. TimepixCam is able to record and time-stamp light flashes in excess of 1,000 photons with high quantum efficiency in the 400–1000nm wavelength range with 20ns timing resolution, corresponding to an effective rate of 50 Megaframes per second. The camera was used for imaging ions impinging on a microchannel plate followed by a phosphor screen. Possible applications include spatial and velocity map imaging of ions in time-of-flight mass spectroscopy; coincidence imaging of ions and electrons, and other time-resolved types of imaging spectroscopy.}

abstract = {Fluorescence from high pressure (0.1–30 bar) rare gas plasmas has been excited using an intense flash X-ray source specially developed and optimized for this experiment. Spectral analysis of the so-called “third continuum” of rare gases is presented. Time-resolved spectroscopy, absorption measurements and pressure dependence studies have provided an extended database on this longer wavelength continuum of rare gases. These data allow us to understand some of the previously contradictory results reported in the literature. They strongly support a multi-component spectral aspect of the previously called “third continuum”. In fact, the observed fluorescence result from the superposition of several continua whose relative intensities are strongly dependent upon pressure. This suggests that different species are at its origin. The name of “third continuum” does not seem anymore appropriate when speaking of the whole fluorescence emitted in the longer wavelength continuum by high pressure rare gas plasmas. Generally speaking, the flash X-ray device was proven to be a very convenient and powerful tool for the study of high pressure plasmas resulting in UV-VUV fluorescence.}

ABSTRACT={Optical readout of micro-pattern gaseous detectors relies on recording scintillation light emitted during electron avalanche multiplication with imaging sensors of high-granularity pixelated readout. It can be used in applications such as optical Time Projection Chambers for track reconstruction, low material budget beam monitoring or radiography, to name but a few. A good match between the scintillation light emission spectra and the spectral sensitivity of the recording devices is required to achieve high signal-to-noise ratios and ensure optimal acquisition parameters. Experimental requirements for operation at low or high pressures may have an impact on the scintillation spectra of gases commonly used for optical readout. We investigate the pressure dependence of scintillation light emission spectra of primary and secondary scintillation in the range of 1,000 mbar down to 25 mbar, in the wavelength range of 200 nm–800 nm. Primary scintillation spectra for different CF4-based mixtures are observed to be independent of pressure in the investigated range. A strong variation in the ratio of ultraviolet (UV) emission to visible (VIS) emission bands is observed as a function of pressure for secondary scintillation of CF4 and He/CF4 mixtures while for Ar/CF4 the overall light yield varies with an almost constant ratio between UV and VIS components. While the addition of low fractions of SF6 as electronegative drift gas does significantly lower the total light output, the shape of the emission spectra is not affected. The observed increase in relative UV emission for low pressure operation in CF4 and He/CF4 mixtures can guide the selection of optical readout devices or wavelength shifters for applications requiring low gas pressure operation.}}

ABSTRACT={We report the scintillation spectra of Ar/CF 4 mixtures in the range 210-800 nm, obtained under X-ray irradiation for various pressures (1-5 bar) and concentrations (0-100%). Special care was taken to eliminate effects related to space charge and charge recombination, so that results can be extrapolated following conventional wisdom to those expected for minimum ionizing particles under the typical electric fields employed in gaseous instrumentation. Our study sheds light into the microscopic pathways leading to scintillation in this family of mixtures and reinvigorates the prospects of use in next-generation scintillation-based chambers.}}

The atomic scattering factors may be accurately determined from the atomic photoabsorption cross sections using modified Kramers-Kronig dispersion relations. From a synthesis of the currently available experimental data and recent theoretical calculations for photoabsorption, the angle-independent, forward-scattering components of the atomic scattering factors have been thus semiempirically determined and tabulated here for 92 elements and for the region 50-30,000 eV. Atomic scattering factors for all angles of coherent scattering and at the higher photon energies are obtained from these tabulated forward-scattering values by adding a simple angle-dependent form-factor correction. The incoherent scattering contributions that become significant for the light elements at the higher photon energies are similarly determined. The basic x-ray interaction relations that are used in applied x-ray physics are presented here in terms of the atomic scattering factors. The bulk optical constants are also related to the atomic scattering factors. These atomic and optical relations are applied to the detailed calculation of the reflectivity characteristics of a series of practical x-ray mirror, multilayer, and crystal monochromators. Comparisons of the results of this semiempirical, "atomic-like" description of x-ray interactions for the low-energy region with those of experiment and ab initio theory are presented.}

abstract = {Rontgen's discovery of X-rays in 1895 launched a subject which became central to the development of modern physics. The verification of many of the predic­ tions of quantum theory by X-ray spectroscopy in the early part of the twen­ tieth century stimulated great interest in thi's area, which has subsequently influenced fields as diverse as chemical physics, nuclear physics, and the study of the electronic properties of solids, and led to the development of techniques such as Auger, Raman, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The improvement of the theoretical understanding of the physics underlying X-ray spectroscopy has been accompanied by advances in experimental techniques, and the subject provides an instructive example of how progress on both these fronts can be mutually beneficial. This book strikes a balance between his­ torical description, which illustrates this symbiosis, and the discussion of new developments. The application of X-ray spectroscopic methods to the in­ vestigation of chemical bonding receives special attention, and an up-to-date account is given of the use of extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) in determining interatomic distances, which has attracted much attention dur­ ing the last decade. This monograph is intended to be used as a basic text for a one-year course at postgraduate level, and aims to provide the general background that is es­ sential to enable the reader to participate fruitfully in the growing research activity in this field.},

In such a simulation, Geant4 is always responsible for the primary particle generation and the interactions that occur in the non-gaseous detector material. Garfield++ on the other hand always deals with the drift of ions and electrons, amplification via electron avalanches and finally signal generation. For the ionizing interaction of particles with the gas, different options and physics models exist. The present paper focuses on how to use Geant4, Garfield++ (including its Heed and SRIM interfaces) and Degrad to create the electron–ion pairs stemming from the ionization of the gas. Software-wise, the proposed idea is to use the Geant4 physics parameterization feature, and to implement a Garfield++ or Degrad based detector simulation as an external model. With a Degrad model, detailed simulations of the X-ray interaction in gaseous detectors, including shell absorption by photoelectric effect, subsequent Auger cascade, shake-off and fluorescence emission, become possible. A simple Garfield++ model can be used for photons (Heed), heavy ions (SRIM) and relativistic charged particles or MIPs (Heed). For non-relativistic charged particles, more effort is required, and a combined Geant4/Garfield++ model must be used. This model, the Geant4/Heed PAI model interface, uses the Geant4 PAI model in conjunction with the Heed PAI model. Parameters, such as the lower production cut of the Geant4 PAI model and the lowest electron energy limit of the physics list have to be set correctly. The paper demonstrates how to determine these parameters for certain values of the W parameter and Fano factor of the gas mixture. The simulation results of this Geant4/Heed PAI model interface are then verified against the results obtained with the stand-alone software packages.}
